# ToyAD

This is a toy implementation of automatic differentiation that I wrote for my own learning, in collaboration with [@jrevels](https://github.com/jrevels/), with a focus on proper handling of complex numbers using the Wirtinger Calculus.

See [this Capstan.jl issue](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/Capstan.jl/issues/1) for some more context on what lead to this implementation, and links to some resources.
